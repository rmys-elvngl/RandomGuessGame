# RandomGuessGame

We are making a "Number Guessing Game" in Java in which we want the user to guess a number randomly chosen by the program between 0-100.

If the number entered by the user is greater or less than the randomly selected number, necessary operations will be made in the if and else blocks, if the number entered by the user is not within the given range, the user will be asked to enter the number again and if he repeats this error more than once, the right of entry will be reduced by one.

Finally, if the user guessed the number, all the numbers entered will be transferred to an array and displayed as output.
